Roughly speaking, my graduate thesis focused on understanding how transport impacts the evolution of stochastic fields. I studied this question in the context of biology. I learned how to work with stochastic differential equations and all sorts of probabilistic ideas and calculus. These were slightly harder, however; they were *spatial* stochastic differential equation!

# Diffusive transport and Evolution

In the below movies, I inoculated different strains of microbes identical in every way except for a different color. We see beautiful patterns develop, indicative of interesting evolution structure. In this case, the *diffusive* transport of cells impacted the evolutionary dynamics.
