My PhD focused on experimentally, theoretically, and numerically investigating how  different forms of transport impact the evolutionary dynamics of growing microbial colonies. As evolution is *random,* I extensively utilized probabilistic random-walk based techniques to model and describe my experiments. Stochastic processes are often modeled via stochastic differential equations (SDEs). 

My work required the use of *spatially extended* SDE's, as I had to take into account the transport  opposed to many stochastic processes that can be modeled via a stochastic differential equation, my problem was slightly more challenging: I had to take into account the *spatial* structure of the colony, and thus had to couple the local  

of  I learned how to work with stochastic differential equations and all sorts of probabilistic ideas and calculus. These were slightly harder, however; they were *spatial* stochastic differential equations!

# Range Expansions: Diffusive Growth and Evolution

The standard experiment I conducted was quite simple. I took multiple identical strains of *E. coli* differing only by the fluroescent protein they produced (their color), mixed them together in growth media, and deposited the media onto the surface of a nutritious agar plate in a small circular droplet roughly 2mm in diameter. Once on the agar surface, the *E. coli* use the local nutrients to grow and proliferate.

The movie below show the growth of three strains of E. coli on an agar plate after initial inoculation. Naively, one would expect that as the colony grows, the different strains of E. coli would remain mixed resulting in a blend of all the colors. Surprisingly, past a certain radius, the colony segregates into one color locally.

In the below movies, I inoculated different strains of microbes identical in every way except for a different color. We see beautiful patterns develop, indicative of interesting evolution structure. In this case, the *diffusive* transport of cells impacted the evolutionary dynamics.
