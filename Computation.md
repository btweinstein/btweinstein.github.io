During my PhD, I've written thousands of IPython/Jupyter notebooks to analyze different types
of data that I have encountered (i.e. images, tabular data, etc.). I have used many different python
packages for data analysis, but I must often use

1. `IPython/Jupyter notebook`
1. `matplotlib, seaborn`
1. `numpy, scipy`
1. `pandas`
1. `scikit-image` (for image processing)
1. `pymc3` (mostly for fitting parameters and estimating their likelihood with monte carlo techniques)
1. `cython` and the gnu-scientific library `cython_gsl` (when I need my analysis to go fast)
1. `PyOpenCL` (when I need my analysis to go *even* faster!)
