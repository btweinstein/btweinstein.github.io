## Random Walk Theory and Applications to Evolution

I authored most of the code in the "[Range Expansion](https://github.com/range-expansions)" Github organization. I will summarize some of the projects below.

### [annihilating_coalescing_walks](https://github.com/Range-Expansions/annihilating_coalescing_walks)

The Cython-based simulation package developed for my [first paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/07/145631). It simulates random walkers constrained on a ring and was calibrated to experiment.

### [expansion_optics](https://github.com/Range-Expansions/expansion_optics)

Determines how a perfectly smooth range expansion with strains that have
 differing growth rates would propagate forwards in time using the fast marching
 method ([scikit-fmm](https://github.com/scikit-fmm/scikit-fmm))
